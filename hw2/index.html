		<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
		<p>
			In this project, I learned how to work with points to create smooth curves called Bezier Curves, and how to use these curves to make surfaces using de Casteljau's algorithm. I also built a tool that lets me smooth out meshes by changing their normal vectors, and use a special way of organizing mesh data called the Half-edge structure to flip and split mesh edges. I used loop subdivision to make meshes finer and smoother. This project taught me a lot about how careful you need to be with pointers and keeping track of everything to make sure the code works right.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>

		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm evaluates Bezier curves by recursively linearly interpolating between control points until a single point is reached. The provided code snippet demonstrates one iteration of this process. It calculates intermediate points between each pair of adjacent control points based on a parameter \(t\), which ranges from 0 to 1. These intermediate points are then used as new control points for the next iteration. The process repeats, reducing the number of points by one each time, until a single point, representing a position on the Bezier curve for the given \(t\), is obtained. This method is a practical way to precisely determine points on a Bezier curve and is implemented here by linearly interpolating between points and returning the new set of points for further processing.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier Surfaces with Separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
	
		<p>
			De Casteljau's algorithm is extended to Bezier surfaces by applying linear interpolation across a grid of control points using two parameters, \(u\) and \(v\), to navigate the surface's dimensions. The process involves two main steps: first, the algorithm interpolates between points along one direction for each row of control points, converting the grid into a single row of intermediate points. Then, it interpolates across these intermediate points using the second parameter (\(v\)), collapsing them into a single point on the Bezier surface corresponding to (\(u\), \(v\)). This implementation starts by linearly interpolating adjacent points with `evaluateStep`, recursively reduces these points to a single dimension with `evaluate1D`, and finally evaluates the Bezier surface at a given (\(u\), \(v\)) with `evaluate`. This method efficiently computes precise points on Bezier surfaces, enabling the creation of detailed and smoothly modeled surfaces.

		<h2 align="middle">Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3 align="middle">Part 3: Area-Weighted Vertex Normals</h3>

		<p>
			To compute area-weighted vertex normals, I aggregated the normals of surrounding triangles, each weighted by its area, to find an average normal at each vertex. Starting with an initial zero vector for accumulation, I looped through each neighboring face of the vertex, skipping any boundary faces. For each face, I calculated its normal by taking the cross product of vectors along its edges, which inherently weights the normal by the triangle's area. These weighted normals were then summed together. The final step involved normalizing this sum to obtain a unit normal vector representing the area-weighted average normal at the vertex. This approach emphasizes the influence of larger triangles in the averaging process, offering a more accurate depiction of the surface's curvature at each vertex.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
	
		<p>
			To implement the edge flip operation, I first checked if the edge was not on a mesh boundary, as flipping boundary edges is not applicable. I then identified all relevant mesh elements around the edge, including vertices, edges, halfedges, and the two adjacent faces. The core of the implementation involved updating the connectivity between these elements. This meant reassigning the 'next', 'twin', 'vertex', 'edge', and 'face' references for each halfedge to reflect the topology after the edge flip. Subsequently, vertices, edges, and faces were updated to point to their new corresponding halfedges, ensuring the mesh's integrity post-operation.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			For debugging, I used a mix of smart tricks to catch mistakes. I looked at the mesh in 3D software to really see what was happening with each flip, which made understanding problems a lot easier. I also wrote down notes in the code (logging) about what was changing, so I could follow along with what was supposed to happen and spot anything odd. Running checks to make sure every part of the mesh still made sense after flipping edges helped catch errors quickly. Starting with very simple shapes and gradually trying out more complex ones let me find and fix issues step by step. These methods were super helpful in making sure everything worked just right, especially for something as tricky as flipping edges on a mesh.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>

		<p>
			Implementing the edge split operation involved dividing a selected edge into two by inserting a new vertex at its midpoint. This process required careful adjustments to the mesh's topology to integrate the new vertex, edges, and faces created by the split.

			First, I checked if the edge was on the boundary of the mesh because splitting a boundary edge requires a different approach. After confirming the edge was suitable for splitting, I identified the halfedges, vertices, and faces surrounding the original edge. A new vertex was then created at the midpoint of the original edge, and new edges and halfedges were generated to connect this vertex with the surrounding vertices, forming new faces in the process. The connectivity between these new and existing elements was meticulously updated to reflect the changes in the mesh's topology, ensuring each element correctly referenced its new neighbors, vertices, edges, and faces.
		</p>

		<p>
			Debugging this operation presented unique challenges due to the complexity of updating multiple interconnected elements. Visual debugging tools were invaluable, allowing me to see the effects of the operation on the mesh and identify any issues with the new topology visually.

		<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>

		<p>
			Implementing Loop subdivision involved several steps to refine a mesh by adding more triangles, aiming for a smoother surface. The process started with updating the positions of existing vertices according to the Loop subdivision rules. This involved calculating a new position for each vertex based on its neighbors, using a specific formula that considers the number of neighboring vertices. Each vertex's new position was temporarily stored without updating its original position to maintain the integrity of the initial mesh structure during the calculation phase.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Next, I calculated new positions for points that would be introduced at the midpoints of existing edges, effectively preparing for the insertion of new vertices into the mesh. Once the new positions were determined, I split every edge in the mesh, introducing new vertices at these calculated midpoints. A crucial step was to differentiate between original and newly created edges to avoid infinite loops of splitting. After splitting the edges, I flipped certain edges to ensure the mesh remained well-formed, specifically flipping those that connected new and old vertices to improve the mesh's topology.
		</p>

		<p>
			For debugging, I employed a strategy of incremental changes and visual inspections. By applying changes gradually and inspecting the mesh at each step, I could isolate and address issues effectively. Automated tests that checked the mesh's consistency after each operation were invaluable for catching errors early. Additionally, visualizing the subdivision process in a 3D modeling tool helped me understand how the algorithm affected the mesh structure, making it easier to spot and correct inaccuracies.

		<p>
			When applying loop subdivision to certain meshes, sharp edges tend to become smoother and rounder, leading to a more uniform mesh appearance. By strategically pre-splitting some edges before applying the subdivision, the smoothing effect on these sharp edges can be lessened. This approach helps in retaining more of the edges' original sharpness and definition.
		</p>

		<p>
			When applying loop subdivision to a cube mesh, achieving symmetrical subdivisions depends on having uniform mesh structures and consistent edge splits/flips. The asymmetry observed in the upsampling process was due to the varied orientation of triangles and the differing number of edges converging at each vertex. This variation meant that during loop subdivision, the calculation of new vertex positions resulted in different coordinates because the degree of vertices (n) varied across the mesh. To address this and promote symmetry, I performed splits on each face's edges and executed specific edge flips. This approach ensured that each corner of the mesh had an equal number of edges extending from it, leading to a more symmetrical mesh after subdivision.
